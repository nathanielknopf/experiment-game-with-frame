        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>You will play a short video game in which your character moves around the world and interacts with objects.</p>
        <p>You can move your character around using the arrow keys on your keyboard.</p>
        <p>The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible in the time allotted. Points can be scored by moving over apples on the screen. However, you have to discover how to make these apples appear.</p>
        <p>Your character has a pocket in which it can store rocks, which can be picked up by moving over them. Note that you can only hold one rock in your pocket at a time.</p>
        <p>Your character can also throw rocks if there is a rock in its pocket. Press the spacebar to throw a rock in the direction your character is facing. After throwing the rock in your character's pocket, your character can pick up a new rock.</p>
        <p>Once your time has run out, you will be redirected to another page where you will be asked questions about the world.</p>
